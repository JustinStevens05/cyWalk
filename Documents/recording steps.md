# Problem
We need a way to represent steps at a certain time. 
We can either use a discrete structure system where we log new steps at regular intervals. 
Or we could store the data in a wave type data structure.


# Discrete steps
One way that we can manage this is by having a list of step objects that we periodically update.
The main drawback of this approach is a lack of assurances that we have multiple updates



# Wave function
A wave function would start by taking in discrete steps as inputs. 
Then it would transform those steps at the end of each day to be some equation. 
We could model these equations with power series or trigonometric equations.
